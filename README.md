# Hacking_tools
## This repository contains hacking tools I made using Python.

## Mac changer tool:
changes the mac address for your linux machine

## IP tracker:
tracks the target's location using his IP address

## Network scanner
scans the network and returns the IP and MAC addresses of other systems in the defined IP range. \
run as root \
unstable (might give wrong output)

## reverse connection malware and handler
plan to make a malware that sends reverse tcp connection and a handler that recieves that connection (using sockets) \
Socket folder contains working client and server classes. and server and client instances that **rickroll** each other. \
the handler and the virus are not complete yet
